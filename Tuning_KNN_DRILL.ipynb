Each billing period per user is scored as being paid on-time or not E.G (0 for No , 1 for Yes). Each user's billing period has the associated purchase category as our independant variables represented as a single point of data. \n",
        "\n",
        "From here we map all user/billing period data along with the binary variable dependant variable. This will give us a decent idea of the decision boundary that exists based on the chosen independant variables. Now as a user makes categorical purchases during a billing period we can model their likely-hood of paying their bill on time. When a user crosses the current model boundary threshold the user/billing period can be flagged.\n",

        "Simplicity of deployment, a model like this would be extremely simple to implement and access its success. Also it's fairly simple to fine tune / parameterize  per user. This is to say when the model was incorrect we can rerun the model with different parameters for each users. "
